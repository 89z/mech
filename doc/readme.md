You can download APKs from different sites [1][2]. If you encounter an XAPK,
this is a Zip format file, so you will need to extract the APK using 7-Zip or
similar. To install, drag file to emulator home screen. To uninstall, long press
on the app, and drag to **Uninstall**. To force stop, long press on the app, and
drag to **App info**.
