## Will you add another site?

If you want to add a new site, just post a new issue. If its a site I am
interested in, I will probably add it for free.

However if I am not interested in the site, then I will need a minimum donation
of 99 USD. I have a PayPal sponsor link, or if you need to use another method,
let me know.
