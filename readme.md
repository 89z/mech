## Why use this module?

It is small. The only third party import is:

~~~
github.com/89z/format
~~~

which in turn only has these third party imports:

~~~
github.com/refraction-networking/utls
google.golang.org/protobuf
~~~

## How to install?

This module works with Windows, macOS or Linux. Check [the releases][2] first.
I dont do a build for every tag, but some tags will have builds available.
First, [download Go][3] and extract archive. Then [download Mech][4] and
extract archive. Then navigate to:

~~~
mech-master/cmd/youtube
~~~

and enter:

~~~
go build
~~~
