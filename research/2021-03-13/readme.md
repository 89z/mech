So it seems this API may not work anymore:

I want to see if anyone is using it successfully.

To get audio URL, we need `license_token` value. To get `license_token` value,
we need `session` value. To get `session` value, we make request to:

~~~
http://www.deezer.com/ajax/gw-light.php?method=deezer.ping&api_version=1.0&api_token
~~~

Can I use this `session` value with the old process? No. Here is a list of all
the Deezer methods:

~~~
deezer.getUserData
deezer.pageTrack
deezer.ping
song.getData
song.getListData
~~~
