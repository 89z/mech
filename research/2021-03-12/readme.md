So I downloaded the Deezer app from here:

https://store.rg-adguard.net

by choosing `ProductId` and entering `9nblggh6j7vv`. The `Fast`, `RP` and
`Retail` options all seem to produce the same result. I downloaded these:

~~~
Deezer.62021768415AF_4.32.30.0_neutral_~_q7m17pa7q8kj0.BlockMap
Deezer.62021768415AF_4.32.30.0_neutral_~_q7m17pa7q8kj0.appxbundle
~~~

and searched but did not find a key. I also extracted `app/Deezer.exe` and
searched it with no luck. I should post the AdGuard site here:

Here is the Android app:

- https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader
- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deezer.android.app

This is the current Android key:

Extract the APK, then look inside `classes.dex`. Here is the Apple app:

https://apps.apple.com/app/deezer-music-podcast-player/id292738169

This is the Apple key:

APK is 27.2 MB. What about Apple? Here is link to Apple iOS IPA file:

which is 138 MB.
