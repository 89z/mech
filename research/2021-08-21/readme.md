For example, take this video [1]. This is a "Topic" video, as confirmed by the
text `Auto-generated by YouTube` in the description. Also it is not marked as
an unlisted video. However it is not listed on the artist video page [2]. If
you search the artist page [3], you wont find it either. You will find the
album on the playlist page [4], and the video is listed on the album playlist
[5].

Whats also interesting, is a Google search will find it [6], so the issue is
specific to YouTube.
