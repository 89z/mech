## L1

Amzn needs AndroidCDM L1 for 720P/1080P/4K, Disney+ needs Android L1 for
1080P+, and NetFlix I think needs L1 for Main Profile & UHD.

playstore, it didnt worked

Try sticking with Android 7-9, start Frida-Server, start Chrome with Bitmovin
or some similar DRM video, then run the dumper. For some reason if you try run
the script first before Chrome, it won't attach to Chrome properly and won't
dump
